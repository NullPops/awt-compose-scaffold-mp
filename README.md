# Requirements  

Android 11 R device

# Building  

Get latest Android Studio / NDK  
Execute bundled run configuration 'Inject' at clone and when modifying api/api-rs/deob/mixins  
You can now build the 'app' module  

# Info
You should be able to use the Account plugin to configure Auto User/Pass, and that will let you login when hitting existing user.  
(properties are stored in sandboxed app data, no other apps can access this data unless your device is rooted.)  
  
You should be able to rotate the camera, long press to open menu, tap to click, organize inventory / bank, and use sliders

You should be able to open the keyboard at any time via the keyboard button on the toolbar and close it by pressing enter  
  
Currently the game renders at 50fps in the Android Emulator and on my personal S24 Ultra.  
Performance has not been tested on other devices.  
  
Please create an issue ONLY if your phone does not have one already, and ONLY for rendering issues.
